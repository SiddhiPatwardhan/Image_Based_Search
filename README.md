# Image-Based Search using ResNet-50

This project demonstrates an image-based search application that uses the ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for feature extraction and image similarity comparison.

## Features
- **Image Feature Extraction**: Uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 model for feature extraction.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for images based on visual similarity.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras , OpenCV.
